# CIS4900: Injection Tracker

The code in this respository is from my CIS4900 Research Project at the University of Guelph. It is a proof of concept for a computer vision based system to automatically track injection sites over time.

## Purpose

Type 1 diabetics must inject insulin multiple times daily to manage their blood glucose levels. To ensure consistent insulin absorption, it is critical to rotate injection sites; failure to do so can lead to lipodystrophy—a condition characterized by the Cleveland Clinic as “a complete or partial loss of and/or abnormal distribution of adipose (fat) tissue in certain areas of your body.” This variability can disrupt the timing between insulin activity and food absorption, complicating glucose control.

This project proposes a computer vision based system to automatically track injection sites over time. By providing users with feedback on site usage and encouraging proper rotation, the system aims to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and improve overall treatment efficacy. 

## Current Progress

- [x] Collected a dataset of 729 images of my navel in various lighting conditions on a GoPro Hero 11 Black camera.
- [x] Labelled the dataset using CVAT to get masks of the navel.
- [x] Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
- [x] Trained a YOLOv11 segmentation model on the dataset.
- [x] Tested the segmentation model on a live video feed from the GoPro.
- [x] Tested basic pose estimation based on the mask generated by the segmentation model.

## Future Plans

- [ ] Collect a larger dataset (through automatic and manual annotation).
- [ ] Use data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's robustness.
- [ ] Explore different approaches to pose estimation:
  - [ ] Augment pose estimation with additional sensors (IMU, ToF sensor, etc.)
  - [ ] Sensor fusion using a Transformer
  - [ ] NVIDIA Simulation to generate synthetic data for training

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `data_processing`: Contains the code for processing the data.
- `demos`: Contains the code for the demos.
